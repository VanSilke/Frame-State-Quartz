# Chassis

In addition to dictating the general look of the frame, a chassis also provides some sort of indication as to how it moves, as well as certain adjustments given to it as a result.

| Chassis Type      | Description        |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Bipedal]]       | 
A standard bipedal frame resembles that of a humanoid, and as such provides the most pilot-frame intuitive integration.
- The frame can move even when staggered.

       |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Reverse Joint]] | 
A reverse-joint frame is a highly mobile biped variant, which can jump great distances at the cost of  lesser resilience.
- Whenever the frame moves from a grounded position, it can move vertically up to 20 meters. This still counts as base movement, and not flight.
- The frame ignores the first 20 meters of falling.

 |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Multiped]]      | 
A multiped has three or more extendable legs, which allow the frame to hold on to difficult terrain.
- The frame can move vertically across surfaces, but does not count as grounded while doing so.

      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Tank]]          | 
A tank frame is heavier and moves on tank threads.
- The frame always begins falling at the end of its turn, even when it would normally remain in the air.

          |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Hover]]         | 
A hover frame  is capable of near-indefinite flight, and usually stays above ground.
- The frame never falls within 20 meters above ground, unless it is staggered.
- The frame does not count as grounded while hovering.
- The frame cannot move while grounded.

         |

# Generator

A generator lies at the heart of the frame, supplying it with power needed to move. In addition, each generator has its own quirks and special uses.

| Chassis Type              | Description                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Coolant Generator]]     | 
A coolant generator is capable of extremely fast energy recovery and avoids overheating like no other.
- The frame may spend between one to four actions to cool down. 
- Cooling down recovers twice as many energy points as actions spent.
- The next overheat recovery test is made with a bonus equal to actions spent.

     |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Plasma Generator]]      | 
A plasma generator outputs power at a reliable rate, even when it would otherwise pause.
- When overheated, the frame still regains 1 energy point at the beginning of its turn.

      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Pulse Generator]]       | 
A pulse  generator allows for the installation and use of pulse expansions.
- Any use of pulse expansion costs 1 energy point.

        |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Singularity Generator]] | 
A singularity  generator allows for the installation and use of weapons with the singularity damage type.
- Any use of singularity damage weapon overheats the frame.
- A singularity generator does not recover energy normally and it cannot be increased with tuning. Instead, it must recharge by recovering from the overheat.
- The frame can also fully recharge energy points by remaining on standby for 1 minute. During that time, it cannot act.

# Weapons

A weapon is a separately usable frame feature, which is usually governed by its own properties based on damage type and tags, which set the weapon's unique rules.

# Weapon Tiers

The strength of a weapon is measured in tiers. Higher weapon tiers are slower and more expensive, but generally hit harder. They also have more points to spend on the tags of the weapon in question.
- Weapon tags usually have up to three tiers. Unique tags have a tier specified in parentheses.
- Damage type grants the weapon an additional property thematically unique to the damage type.

| Tier |     Use Cost      | Base Damage | Base Range | Tag Points |
| :--: | :---------------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  I   |      1 step       |     d4      |     5      |     3      |
|  II  |      2 steps      |     d6      |     7      |     5      |
| III  | 2 steps; 1 energy |     d8      |     9      |     7      |
# Weapon Types
Based on the general weapon type, the base is modified.

| Weapon Type | Targeting Bonus |          Attribute Benefit          | Caveat                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------: | --------------- | :---------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Melee    | Servo Assist    |  Add Servo Assist value to damage.  | The weapon always has a range of 1, and cannot be modified outside of effects that specify melee.                                                 |
|   Shooter   | Aim Assist      |                  -                  | -                                                                                                                                                 |
|   Lock-on   | Lock Correction | Add Lock Correction value to range. | The weapon's minimum range value is moved by Lock Correction. Using the weapon below the minimum range does not add Lock Correction to targeting. |

# Weapon Tags

Each weapon tag modifies the way a weapon is played in some way, either casually through straight improvement, or by some sort of alteration to the base way in which it is used.
- A weapon can have a weapon tag of a specified name only once, no matter the tiers.
- A weapon can have any arrangement of tags otherwise.

| Weapon Tag                 | Brief                                                |

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Homing]]            | Provides own targeting die.                          |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Reach]]             | Longer range, or longer melee reach.                 |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Multifire]]         | Fires in quick succession at a single use.           |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Rapid Fire]]        | Can be used more than once in a turn.                |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Lock]]              | Increased accuracy (at the cost of additional step). |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Zone In]]           | Slow acting huge payload.                            |

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Arc]]               | Arcs the projectile over and around obstacles.       |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Weapon Tags Folder/Tag, Tracer]]            | Highlights the target.                               |

# Damage Type

By selecting a damage type, you can choose from among several damage-specific tags.

| Damage Type             | Description              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Kinetic]]     | 
Kinetic damage is the most common method of inflicting harm. A well-placed round is often the most deadly.
- Increase base damage die of the weapon by one stage.
- Increase direct hit damage die of the weapon by one stage.     |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Energy]]      | 
Energy damage is less common, but scales well off the generator.
- Inflicts bonus damage equal to the current energy point pool.
- This bonus damage, if mitigated, does not convert to impact.      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Blast]]       | 
Blast damage is the best at generating powerful shockwaves. 
- Mitigated damage inflicts impact twice on non-staggered units.
- This bonus impact does not reduce integrity of staggered units.       |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Wave]]        | 
Wave damage strongly resonates, targeting the weakest link.
- Hitting a staggered unit always counts as a direct hit, causing some bonus damage.
- Using a wave weapon requires additional 1 energy.        |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Singularity]] | 
Singularity damage makes for highly dangerous armaments.
- Damage taken from a singularity weapon cannot be mitigated by any means.
- Using a singularity weapon automatically overheats the user immediately after the attack resolves. |

| Damage Tag         | Damage Type | Brief                                |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Pierce]]    | Kinetic     | Pierces through mitigation.          |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Plasma]]    | Energy      | Inflicts unavoidable damage.         |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, EMP]]       | Energy      | Directly attacks the unit's systems. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Napalm]]    | Blast       | Inflicts damage over time.           |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Rebound]]   | Blast       | Guarantees small amounts of damage.  |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Resonance]] | Wave        | Increases damage taken.              |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Tags Folder/Tag, Anomaly]]   | Singularity | Directly increases incoming damage.  |

# Hull and OS

The hull and OS are described more loosely than other components, as they rely on point buy spent on attributes.

Initially, all attributes begin with values of 0, and the Pilot has 10 points to allocate.

| Attribute                 | Use Case                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Plating, Kinetic]] | Adds to Kinetic Defence.                           |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Plating, Energy]]  | Adds to Energy Defence.                            |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Plating, Blast]]   | Adds to Blast Defence.                             |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Bulk]]             | Adds to Integrity.                                 |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, System Recovery]]  | Adds to stability and recovers stability faster.   |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Ablative Layer]]   | Negates some damage for a limited number of times. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Hull and OS Tags Folder/Tag, Scanner]]          | Adds to surveys. Increases weapon ranges.          |

# Tuning

The frame, its components and weapons can be extensively tuned, providing bonuses to individual elements within the frame's stat block. Any one element can be tuned up to three times, each time improving the associated die or value by one grade.
- While the maximum die size is d12, improving such a die by a grade again provides cumulative +1 bonus to any tests associated with that die.
# Expansions

Didn't have the energy to write up each expansion in full, so here's the list of ideas taken from an older variant. Some of these overlap with recently-added weapon/armour/OS tags.

|       Expansion Module        | Tier | Brief                                                 |
