Missions have a base payout, offered if the Pilots succeed at the primary objective. A mission can have secondary or hidden objectives, which provide bonus pay. On the other hand, the employer may reduce pay if an objective is mismanaged.
- Most of the variables should be shown before the mission so as to avoid confusion.

# Mission Costs
While on a mission, keep track of each integrity loss and each use of a weapon. When the mission concludes, tally up the total Cost for each and multiply it by 5 to receive the credit fee.
- Each integrity point lost has 1 Cost.
- Each weapon use has Cost based on its tier

| Mission Cost     | Cost pt.    |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Integrity Loss   | 1 per point |
| T I Weapon Use   | 1 per use   |
| T II Weapon Use  | 2 per use   |
| T III Weapon Use | 3 per use   
# Debt
If the costs are too high, you may go into a negative, which reduces your currency instead of adding to it, potentially getting you into debt. Debt is more of a narrative device, since you can still use assembly however you like, but it renders you unable to advance your stats until you go out of the negative and earn usable money.
