A designation, or a point of interest, is a mechanical device for describing any important map feature, including yourself, allies, enemies, and obstacles. A designation always occupies at least one hex. If multiple important things exist within the same hex, choose which one to designate.

Normally, you can only designate points of interest you can see.
