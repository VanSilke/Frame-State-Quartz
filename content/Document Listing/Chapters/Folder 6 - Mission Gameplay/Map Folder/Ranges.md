A range is the maximum possible distance, within which something can operate - be it the frame's movement, the weapon, and otherwise, measured from the origin point of the range (such as the frame's current position, or the epicentre of the explosion). 
- Hexes that cannot be reached within the maximum number of steps are effectively out of range.
- Normally ranges can be angled to avoid invalid hexes, for example when moving around an obstacle.
- Straight ranges cannot be angled. A point is out of straight range if you can't draw a straight, unobstructed line to it (handler being the final arbiter).
