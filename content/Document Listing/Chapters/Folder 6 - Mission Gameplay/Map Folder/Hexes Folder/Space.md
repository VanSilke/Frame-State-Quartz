Technically hovering above the grid of some other hex, it is a 10-metre column of empty space. Space can be stacked indefinitely unless the map has some sort of ceiling. Most commonly used for flying.
- If you enter an air hex during ground movement, the movement ends and you begin to fall unless you flew.
- If you begin your turn in an air hex, you begin to fall.
