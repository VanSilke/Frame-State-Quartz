Treated identically to a terrain hex, except it can be destroyed with enough effort, and can lie atop another hex type (typically terrain). 
- If a unit occupies a destroyed prop, it begins to fall.

Destructible props have a single value, from 1 upward. The value equals the prop's integrity, as well as all defences equally. The value is typically assigned by the handler.
