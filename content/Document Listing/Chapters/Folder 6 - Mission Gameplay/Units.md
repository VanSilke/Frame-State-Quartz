All remarkable things within the context of the conflict are considered units. Pilot players are units, as are all NPCs of some disposition.

# Player Pilots
As a player pilot, you are capable of piloting a frame, which is considered "you" within the context of conflicts. Player pilots act during the friendly segment in an order they agree on.

# NPCs
An NPC, or a Non-Player Character, can be just about anything that can move, shoot, or interact with the player pilots, like a hostile frame. Each NPC has some sort of disposition toward the player pilots.

Determining disposition is a narrative act performed by the handler. An NPC can be allied, neutral, or an enemy.
- Ally NPCs act on the ally segment right after the pilot players. They are friendly towards the pilot players, and fight alongside them. If antagonized, they can become neutral or even enemies.
- Neutral NPCs act on the neutral segment right after the ally NPCs. Neutral NPCs are indifferent at the time of the conflict, and fight for themselves, switching allegiances whenever it suits them.
- Enemy NPCs act on the enemy segment right after the neutral NPCs. They fight to kill the pilot players.
