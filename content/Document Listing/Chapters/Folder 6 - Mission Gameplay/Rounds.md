While in conflict, the game slows down to seconds at a time, and operates in an abstract manner within a round. During a round, units act one after another, and once all have acted or abstained from doing so, the round ends and another begins.
- A unit is any one element on the map that acts in some way with the round abstraction. This can be friendlies (Pilot players) or NPCs of any allegiance.

# Round Segments
A round is separated into a number of individual segments during which units act grouped by allegiance.

| Round Segment | Units Played                                                                                                                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Friendly      | Pilots and their frames. Players decide among each other who wants to act and when, but individual turns must be played out in full.    |
| Ally          | NPCs allied to the Pilot players. They act in support of the Pilot players during the conflict, although their own goals take priority. |
| Neutral       | NPCs neutral to the Pilot players, indifferent to the conflict.                                                                         |
| Enemy         | NPCs hostile to the Pilot players, who fight to destroy Pilots and their frames, or prevent them from doing something.                  |
| Environmental | Environmental effects, such as falling, occur during this segment.                                                                      |
# Taking your Turn
1. Declare start turn (in agreement with other players) and apply events that occur at the beginning of your turn.
2. Perform any actions you can think of within reason, until all resources or options have been exhausted. You may declare to end your turn early to preserve resources, or if you cannot think of any actions to take.
3. Declare end turn, and apply events that occur at the end of your turn.
4. Move on to the next player Pilot or NPC.

# Falling

Falling is a form of forced, straight vertical movement, which occurs once per round during the environmental segment. It applies to all units that have the falling state. 
- Player-piloted frames usually fall when they neglected to fly during their turn.
- When falling, the unit moves 100 metres down.
- If during this movement the unit encounters a non-air hex, and the fall was longer than 10 metres, then the unit stops falling and takes 10 impact.
