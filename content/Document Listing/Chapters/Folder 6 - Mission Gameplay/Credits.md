Credits are an in-game currency you earn through missions and spend on personal advancement. Each starting character begins with 100 credits in their account, and this amount fluctuates throughout the game. Oftentimes, you will have invested most of your credits into your frame and your ability to pilot it.

There is no real-life equivalent to credits, but it is purposed that 10 credit units would warrant mundane currency enough to comfortably live for about a month. In the narrative, it's assumed that you either need or want to make a large amount of money and constantly reinvest it into your frame.

Trading credits between player pilots is encouraged. Whether it is done with kindness of heart or a narrative favour, is up to you as players.
