The map describes where everything is situated, including but not limited to the pilot, their frame, NPCs and obstacles.

The map is separated into an even hexagonal column grid. The distance from one centre of the hex to the centre of another adjacent hex is equal 10 metres, and minor inconsistencies are ignored.
- Hexes are adjacent when connected by an edge. Hexes connected by only a corner are not adjacent.
- Mechanically, everything occupies space as close to the centre of its hex as possible. As such, the effective distance between things is always 10 metres, even if they are narratively "hugging" the adjacent edge.
