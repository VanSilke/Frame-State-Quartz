Much like the frame, weapons have their own statistical elements. The statistics are given once for each weapon. Since a frame can have multiple weapons on board, it is important to have each armament described separately.

Furthermore, these basic statistics do not reflect the full extent of a weapon's utility, as most of it comes from the damage type and chosen tags.
