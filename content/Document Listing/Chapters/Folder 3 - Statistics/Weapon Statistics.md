Much like the frame, weapons have their own statistical elements. The statistics are given once for each weapon. Since a frame can have multiple weapons on board, it is important to have each armament described separately.

Furthermore, these basic statistics do not reflect the full extent of a weapon's utility, as most of it comes from the damage type and chosen tags.

| Weapon Statistics | Description      |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats NEW/Targeting]]     | 
**Statistic**
Based  on weapon type. Acts as a modifier to targeting tests made with the weapon.   |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats NEW/Base Damage]]   | 
**Statistic**
Based on weapon tier. Describes the expected harm the weapon causes on a successful hit. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Weapon Stats NEW/Range]]         | 
**Statistic**
Based on weapon. Describes the effective range of a weapon.
- If you attempt to use a weapon out of range, your targeting test has a cumulative -2 penalty for each hex beyond the range.       |
