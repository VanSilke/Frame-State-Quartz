The generator provides the statistics for a more optional, but nevertheless highly important element of energy management.

| Generator Statistics | Description   |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Generator Stats Folder/Energy Capacity]]           | 
**Resource**
Based on generator. Describes the size of the frame's energy storage.
- You lose energy points when performing actions and abilities that cost energy.
- You replenish energy equal to the Energy Recharge statistic at the beginning of your turn.

When attempting to use something that requires energy while the energy is already 0, the unit overheats.   |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 3 - Statistics/Generator Stats Folder/Energy Recharge]]         | 
**Statistic**
Based on generator. Describes how fast the frame replenishes its energy.
- Sets the rate at which Energy Capacity replenishes its points.

When a unit has 0 recharge but has an energy resource, it cannot replenish its energy at all unless specified otherwise. |
