When your unit is in a bad location on the map and you want to change it, you can spend resources to move.
- Moving always uses the unit's speed statistic to set the movement range. 
- The movement range may or may not be straight. It usually is not, allowing the unit to meander freely.

# Base Movement
During base movement, a unit spends 1 step to move up to its movement range.
- This movement must be horizontal, and must respect terrain rules.
- Occasional terrain elements, such as inclines, may allow vertical movement.
- Certain abilities and components modify the capabilities of base movement.

# Flight
If base movement is not enough, the unit can fly. This uses 1 step and 1 energy point.
- The movement can be horizontal, vertical, or both, in whichever order you wish.
- While an upward-angled boost can be narrated as such, it must be abstracted into a sum of horizontal and vertical movement, as normal.
- You may fly as high as 10 times your movement range in metres above the terrain level.

# Maintaining Flight
If you flew, you do not fall until the beginning of your next turn.
- If you wish, you may safely descend with double your speed. This costs no steps or energy.
- If you flew, and happen to occupy space above the max height limit, you descend safely right below it.
- If you do not wish to move from the currently occupied hex, you may spend 1 energy point without spending any steps. This extends your falling immunity to the beginning of your next turn.

# Forced Movement
Certain events, such as involuntary falling, count as forced movement. Forced movement does not use up your own resources in any capacity unless told otherwise. Usually, forced movement occurs outside your turn.
