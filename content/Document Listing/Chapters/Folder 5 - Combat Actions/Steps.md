Steps are a special resource available to all functioning units on the field. Almost all actions require that you spend at least one step as part of performing those actions.
- You may have a maximum of 4 steps at any given time.
- You recover all steps at the beginning of your turn.

# Acting Outside Your Turn
If you forfeited a step during your turn (ended before using all of them), you can use it during the rest of the round. 
- The action can not cost more than one step.
- Performing the action always costs one step, even if it would normally be free.

In order to act outside your turn, you must make a mark 5 Sharpness test. If you succeed, you manage to act just before the event you reacted to. If you fail, you either waste the step, or act immediately after the event has concluded.
