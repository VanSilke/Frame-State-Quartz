When you have an enemy in sight and want to commence hostilities, you can spend resources to use one of your weapons to attack. The following standard resolution applies to all sorts of attack events, weapon use being only one among them.

# 1. Targeting and Evasion
Using a weapon requires that you designate a point of interest. Make a targeting test against the designation's evasion. If the designation cannot evade, the mark is 0.
- Critical: You score a direct hit on the designation and deal additional d4 damage, rolled as a bonus value.
- Success: You score a normal hit on the designation and deal damage.
- Failure: You miss the designation. Do not apply any special effects reliant on hitting the designation.

| Targeting | Evasion |
| :-------: | :-----: |
| Sharpness | Synergy |

If you are being targeted by an enemy, the situation is reversed and the enemy can get a critical if you fail by 2 or more, dealing additional damage to you or your frame.

# 2. Damage
When a unit is hit with a damaging effect, it takes damage, calculated with all relevant bonuses and penalties. This is set as incoming damage. As an aggressor, you usually make a damage test. A damage test can ace, but cannot have a critical by itself.
- The unit reduces the incoming damage by its relevant defences, if any, and records the amount mitigated in this way, as it later converts to impact. The remaining damage is subtracted from the unit's integrity points.
- If the unit has any sort of damage negation, it may apply before or after the mitigation. Negated damage is not recorded nor converted to impact.

|    Damage     | Mitigation |
| :-----------: | :--------: |
| Weapon Damage |   Smarts   |

If you are being damaged, the situation is reversed. The incoming damage is static, and you must make a mitigation test based on your Smarts to see how much damage is converted to impact. 

# 3. Impact
After the unit has taken damage (regardless if the damage reduced its integrity or not), it takes the recorded amount of damage its defences managed to mitigate as impact. The result is identical whether you are the aggressor or defender, the only thing that changes is who gets harmed.
- The unit takes the calculated impact, losing that amount of stability points, possibly staggering the unit.
- If the unit is already staggered, it cannot lose any more stability. Instead, the unit loses integrity points equal to the calculated impact.
