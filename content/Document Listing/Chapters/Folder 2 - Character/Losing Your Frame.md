Inevitably, you may face a situation in which you lose your frame in battle or as a result of some mishap. If your frame is destroyed on a mission, you must either eject or go down with the collapsing machine. If you die, you must make an entirely new pilot.

When you eject, you remain a vulnerable target as a simple human. You can take only one point of harm for you to become inoperable. As a human, you have a speed of 1, able to traverse 3 hexes per turn. If you do survive a conflict and manage to somehow extract from the mission, you can try measuring your options.
- Riding on top of an allied frame is a bold choice, since any sort of jostle will make you fall.
- A frame with a free hand can safely hold you, although explosions and similar area damage will kill you.

A brand new frame costs a small fortune of 3,000c. It retains no point upgrades from the previous one (with the exception of your own skills, since they are not tied to the machine), although you may redistribute the new frame's points it to your liking. If you managed to extract the wreck as well, you may refit the new frame with the wreck's remaining parts and follow leftover schematics to expediate and cheapen the process of reacquiring your lost power.

Tally up the total upgrade costs which you have spent on purchasing points for tuning, expansions and weapons, including individual weapon limits. Divide that total by 10. The result is the amount of credits you can salvage and reuse to refit the new chassis, with any new arrangement of points.
