The frame, its components and weapons can be extensively tuned, providing bonuses to individual elements within the frame's stat block. Any one element can be tuned up to three times, each time improving the associated die or value by one grade.
- While the maximum die size is d12, improving such a die by a grade again provides cumulative +1 bonus to any tests associated with that die.
