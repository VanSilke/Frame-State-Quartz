A weapon is a separately usable frame feature, which is usually governed by its own properties based on damage type and tags, which set the weapon's unique rules.

# Weapon Tiers

The strength of a weapon is measured in tiers. Higher weapon tiers are slower and more expensive, but generally hit harder. They also have more points to spend on the tags of the weapon in question.
- Weapon tags usually have up to three tiers. Unique tags have a tier specified in parentheses.
- Damage type grants the weapon an additional property thematically unique to the damage type.

| Tier |     Use Cost      | Base Damage | Base Range | Tag Points |
| :--: | :---------------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  I   |      1 step       |     d4      |     5      |     3      |
|  II  |      2 steps      |     d6      |     7      |     5      |
| III  | 2 steps; 1 energy |     d8      |     9      |     7      |
# Weapon Types
Based on the general weapon type, the base is modified.

| Weapon Type | Targeting Bonus |          Attribute Benefit          | Caveat                                                                                                                                            |
| :---------: | --------------- | :---------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Melee    | Servo Assist    |  Add Servo Assist value to damage.  | The weapon always has a range of 1, and cannot be modified outside of effects that specify melee.                                                 |
|   Shooter   | Aim Assist      |                  -                  | -                                                                                                                                                 |
|   Lock-on   | Lock Correction | Add Lock Correction value to range. | The weapon's minimum range value is moved by Lock Correction. Using the weapon below the minimum range does not add Lock Correction to targeting. |

# Weapon Tags

Each weapon tag modifies the way a weapon is played in some way, either casually through straight improvement, or by some sort of alteration to the base way in which it is used.
- A weapon can have a weapon tag of a specified name only once, no matter the tiers.
- A weapon can have any arrangement of tags otherwise.

| Weapon Tag                 | Brief                                                |

# Damage Type

By selecting a damage type, you can choose from among several damage-specific tags.

| Damage Type             | Description              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Kinetic]]     | 
Kinetic damage is the most common method of inflicting harm. A well-placed round is often the most deadly.
- Increase base damage die of the weapon by one stage.
- Increase direct hit damage die of the weapon by one stage.     |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Energy]]      | 
Energy damage is less common, but scales well off the generator.
- Inflicts bonus damage equal to the current energy point pool.
- This bonus damage, if mitigated, does not convert to impact.      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Blast]]       | 
Blast damage is the best at generating powerful shockwaves. 
- Mitigated damage inflicts impact twice on non-staggered units.
- This bonus impact does not reduce integrity of staggered units.       |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Wave]]        | 
Wave damage strongly resonates, targeting the weakest link.
- Hitting a staggered unit always counts as a direct hit, causing some bonus damage.
- Using a wave weapon requires additional 1 energy.        |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Singularity]] | 
Singularity damage makes for highly dangerous armaments.
- Damage taken from a singularity weapon cannot be mitigated by any means.
- Using a singularity weapon automatically overheats the user immediately after the attack resolves. |
