In addition to dictating the general look of the frame, a chassis also provides some sort of indication as to how it moves, as well as certain adjustments given to it as a result.

| Chassis Type      | Description        |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Bipedal]]       | 
A standard bipedal frame resembles that of a humanoid, and as such provides the most pilot-frame intuitive integration.
- The frame can move even when staggered.

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Reverse Joint]] | 
A reverse-joint frame is a highly mobile biped variant, which can jump great distances at the cost of  lesser resilience.
- Whenever the frame moves from a grounded position, it can move vertically up to 20 meters. This still counts as base movement, and not flight.
- The frame ignores the first 20 meters of falling.

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Multiped]]      | 
A multiped has three or more extendable legs, which allow the frame to hold on to difficult terrain.
- The frame can move vertically across surfaces, but does not count as grounded while doing so.

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Tank]]          | 
A tank frame is heavier and moves on tank threads.
- The frame always begins falling at the end of its turn, even when it would normally remain in the air.

          |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Chassis Folder/Hover]]         | 
A hover frame  is capable of near-indefinite flight, and usually stays above ground.
- The frame never falls within 20 meters above ground, unless it is staggered.
- The frame does not count as grounded while hovering.
- The frame cannot move while grounded.
