| Damage Type             | Description              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Kinetic]]     | 
Kinetic damage is the most common method of inflicting harm. A well-placed round is often the most deadly.
- Increase base damage die of the weapon by one stage.
- Increase direct hit damage die of the weapon by one stage.     |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Energy]]      | 
Energy damage is less common, but scales well off the generator.
- Inflicts bonus damage equal to the current energy point pool.
- This bonus damage, if mitigated, does not convert to impact.      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Blast]]       | 
Blast damage is the best at generating powerful shockwaves. 
- Mitigated damage inflicts impact twice on non-staggered units.
- This bonus impact does not reduce integrity of staggered units.       |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Wave]]        | 
Wave damage strongly resonates, targeting the weakest link.
- Hitting a staggered unit always counts as a direct hit, causing some bonus damage.
- Using a wave weapon requires additional 1 energy.        |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Weapon NEW Folder Main/Damage Types Folder NEW/Damage, Singularity]] | 
Singularity damage makes for highly dangerous armaments.
- Damage taken from a singularity weapon cannot be mitigated by any means.
- Using a singularity weapon automatically overheats the user immediately after the attack resolves. |
