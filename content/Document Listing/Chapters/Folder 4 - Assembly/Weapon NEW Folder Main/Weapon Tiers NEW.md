The strength of a weapon is measured in tiers. Higher weapon tiers are slower and more expensive, but generally hit harder. They also have more points to spend on the tags of the weapon in question.
- Weapon tags usually have up to three tiers. Unique tags have a tier specified in parentheses.
- Damage type grants the weapon an additional property thematically unique to the damage type.

| Tier |     Use Cost      | Base Damage | Base Range | Tag Points |
| :--: | :---------------: | :---------: | :--------: | :--------: |
|  I   |      1 step       |     d4      |     5      |     3      |
|  II  |      2 steps      |     d6      |     7      |     5      |
| III  | 2 steps; 1 energy |     d8      |     9      |     7      |
# Weapon Types
Based on the general weapon type, the base is modified.

| Weapon Type | Targeting Bonus |          Attribute Benefit          | Caveat                                                                                                                                            |

|    Melee    | Servo Assist    |  Add Servo Assist value to damage.  | The weapon always has a range of 1, and cannot be modified outside of effects that specify melee.                                                 |
|   Shooter   | Aim Assist      |                  -                  | -                                                                                                                                                 |
|   Lock-on   | Lock Correction | Add Lock Correction value to range. | The weapon's minimum range value is moved by Lock Correction. Using the weapon below the minimum range does not add Lock Correction to targeting. |
