The weapon automatically homes in on its target. Instead of your own Sharpness, add the Homing die to the targeting tests made with the weapon. You can still use your own Sharpness during the test, as a choice.

1. The Homing die is d6.
2. The Homing die is d8. Additionally, if the weapon misses, check again if it would hit on the die result of 2. If it would, the weapon does hit. You cannot get a critical in this way.
3. The Homing die is d10. Additionally, if the weapon misses, check again if it would hit on the die result of 4. If it would, the weapon does hit. You cannot get a critical in this way.
