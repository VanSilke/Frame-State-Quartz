The weapon's projectile fires off in an arc rather than a relatively straight line. As a result, it can target things more easily.

1. The weapon arcs vertically. As long as you can draw a straight line in the air between yourself and the designated hex, you may target it normally.
2. The weapon arcs in a three-dimensional plane. As long as you can draw any sort of path between yourself and the designated hex, you may target it normally. The length of the path must be equal or less than the weapon's range.
3. The weapon arcs in a three-dimensional plane. As long as you can draw any sort of path between yourself and the designated hex, you may target it normally. The length of the path is irrelevant, as long as the designation remains within the weapon's range.
