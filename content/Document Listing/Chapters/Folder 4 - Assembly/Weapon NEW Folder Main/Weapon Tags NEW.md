Each weapon tag modifies the way a weapon is played in some way, either casually through straight improvement, or by some sort of alteration to the base way in which it is used.
- A weapon can have a weapon tag of a specified name only once, no matter the tiers.
- A weapon can have any arrangement of tags otherwise.
