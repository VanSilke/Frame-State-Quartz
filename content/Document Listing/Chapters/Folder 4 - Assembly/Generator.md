A generator lies at the heart of the frame, supplying it with power needed to move. In addition, each generator has its own quirks and special uses.

| Chassis Type              | Description                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Coolant Generator]]     | 
A coolant generator is capable of extremely fast energy recovery and avoids overheating like no other.
- The frame may spend between one to four actions to cool down. 
- Cooling down recovers twice as many energy points as actions spent.
- The next overheat recovery test is made with a bonus equal to actions spent.

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Plasma Generator]]      | 
A plasma generator outputs power at a reliable rate, even when it would otherwise pause.
- When overheated, the frame still regains 1 energy point at the beginning of its turn.

      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Pulse Generator]]       | 
A pulse  generator allows for the installation and use of pulse expansions.
- Any use of pulse expansion costs 1 energy point.

| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Wave Generator]]        | 
A wave  generator allows for the installation and use of weapons with the wave damage type.
- Any use of wave damage weapon costs 1 energy point.

        |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 4 - Assembly/Generator Folder/Singularity Generator]] | 
A singularity  generator allows for the installation and use of weapons with the singularity damage type.
- Any use of singularity damage weapon overheats the frame.
- A singularity generator does not recover energy normally and it cannot be increased with tuning. Instead, it must recharge by recovering from the overheat.
- The frame can also fully recharge energy points by remaining on standby for 1 minute. During that time, it cannot act.
