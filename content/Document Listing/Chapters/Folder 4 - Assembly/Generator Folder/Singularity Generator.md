A singularity  generator allows for the installation and use of weapons with the singularity damage type.
- Any use of singularity damage weapon overheats the frame.
- A singularity generator does not recover energy normally and it cannot be increased with tuning. Instead, it must recharge by recovering from the overheat.
- The frame can also fully recharge energy points by remaining on standby for 1 minute. During that time, it cannot act.
