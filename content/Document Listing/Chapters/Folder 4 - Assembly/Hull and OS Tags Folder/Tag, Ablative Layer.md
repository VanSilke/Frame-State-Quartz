The frame has an ablative layer of additional armour added atop the core plating. Whenever the frame is damaged for the first time in a round, a layer peels off, negating a number of damage before it can harm the frame or be mitigated by core plating. This automatically expends one use of ablative layer. Ablative layer uses are recovered during repairs.

1. The ablative layer negates 2 damage, and is usable once between repairs.
2. The ablative layer negates 4 damage, and is usable twice between repairs.
3. The ablative layer negates 6 damage, and is usable three times between repairs.
