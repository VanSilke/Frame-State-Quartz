The frame is directly more resistant to energy damage.

1. Add 2 to mitigation against energy damage.
2. Add 3 to mitigation against energy damage. Additionally, surge protectors protect delicate subsystems, reducing stability loss from mitigation by 1.
3. Add 4 to mitigation against energy damage. Additionally, surge protectors protect delicate subsystems, reducing stability loss from mitigation by 1. Further, you negate 2 damage caused by energy impact while staggered.
