Mechanically, the frame consists of numerous statistics tied to its different parts.
- A frame statistic is a property of a frame, which can influence tests and other aspects of the game. It is usually a value, but can have dice in it.
- If the statistic has a die, it is rerolled every time the statistic is called for. For example, if the weapon has a die in its damage statistic, that die is rerolled every time the weapon damages something, with some exceptions.
- Dice within statistics can ace, adding 2 to the statistic as a modifier.

The statistics are arranged in order of occurrence, from chassis through generators to weapons.
- Chassis
- OS
- Generator
- Weapon
