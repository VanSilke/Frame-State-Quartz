An action is a brief (done within the span of a second or two) event you perform during your turn to interact with the world around you.
- Performing actions tends to consume resources, typically steps or energy points.

Some actions are codified, the rest can be improvised. Some actions have use conditions - if those are not met, the action cannot be used.
