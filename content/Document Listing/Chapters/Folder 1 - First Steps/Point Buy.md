Creating any sort of character element operates on point buy, linearly purchasing attributes with points. 
- One point increases an attribute by one grade.
- Each advancement category has its own point pool.
- You cannot exchange points between point pools.

# Point Allocation
Attributes have two types: Die and Val. Die attribute offers dice, and Val attribute offers values.
- Allocating a point in a Die type attribute permanently increases the offered die by one grade, from d4 to d6, and so on, up to d12.
- Allocating a point in a Val type attribute permanently increases the offered value by 1, up to 5.
- You cannot allocate points into a Die attribute that is already d12, or a Val attribute that is already 5.

# Advancement
A Pilot may use time between missions on training and improving their technology, either by personal research, buying up existing parts, or augmentation surgeries. However you explain it, advancement costs the same, based on category.
* When deciding on advancement, you choose a category and spend an associated amount of currency. When you do so, you gain one point in that category, increasing its maximum permanently. 
* You may advance a single category a finite number of times. After a limit, the advancement in that category halts.
* When you do upgrade your frame in any way, keep track of the total upgrade costs, in case you lose it and need to refit the new one with old parts.

# Experimental Awards
Occasionally, you may come across experimental upgrades, ranging from +1 to +3, inputted as a value as if they were normal points, but without interacting with the point limits. An experimental upgrade adds its value to any result or statistic generated from the attribute it was inserted to, even if the original value is a die.

# Refitting
Refitting a frame is much less costly than outright improving it.
- When deciding on a refit, you choose a category and spend one-tenth of the associated amount of currency.
- Choose one point to permanently lose, from any one attribute into which you had already invested at least one point during initial character generation or further advancement.
- You gain one new point, which can be assigned to another attribute within the same category.
