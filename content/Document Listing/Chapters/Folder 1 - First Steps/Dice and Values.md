Aside from acting out their roles in the narrative, players (primarily Pilots) interact with the game world by rolling dice, tallying values, and comparing outcomes.

# Dice
Dice (singular die) output a random full number between 1 and its maximum when rolled. A die is signified by a "d" prefix, followed by the maximum number it can generate. Usually, you roll only one die per context given.
- There are many die types, ranging from d4 to d12.
- When a die is rolled, the generated number is called a natural result.
- When the result is the maximum possible for the die, it is called an ace.
- Values count for themselves, and range from 1 upward.

Additionally, each die is tied to several variables:
- AVG is the "average" outcome, sometimes used instead of a roll.
- MAX is the maximum possible outcome for the die roll.
- Grade is used in the context of character building and some special mechanics.

# Base Reference Table

| Type | AVG | MAX | Grade |
| :--: | :-: | :-: | :---: |
|  -   |  -  |  -  |   0   |
|  d4  |  3  |  4  |   1   |
|  d6  |  4  |  6  |   2   |
|  d8  |  5  |  8  |   3   |
| d10  |  6  | 10  |   4   |
| d12  |  7  | 12  |   5   |
