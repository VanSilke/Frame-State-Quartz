Whenever the Pilot attempts to do something dangerous (like do anything during combat) or interesting (as determined by the Handler), it becomes a test.

# Pilot Facing Tests
The tests are Pilot-facing at all times. This means, that Pilots always roll during a test, and NPCs (and other events described by the Handler) never do. Narratively, it is because of the players' competence that they persist through the challenges, and not because their foes fumbled.



| Term | Brief     |

| Mark | 
A mark is a test value set by the Handler.
- If your score is above this value, you "hit the mark", otherwise you "miss the mark", with variable outcome on a draw and extreme outcome on a critical or fumble. |




| Initiator | Test Type | Difference                                                    | On Draw |
| :-------: | :-------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
|   Pilot   | Proactive | When a Pilot hits the mark by 2 or more, they get a critical. | Hit     |
|  Handler  | Reactive  | When a Pilot misses the mark by 2 or more, they get a fumble. | Miss    |

A mark is a test value set by the Handler.
- If your score is above this value, you "hit the mark", otherwise you "miss the mark", with variable outcome on a draw and extreme outcome on a critical or fumble.     |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Score]]    | 
A score is a test value calculated by summing the natural result and modifiers. 
- The goal of a test is to generate the highest score.    |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Ace]]      | 
An ace is a test event in which a Pilot has rolled the maximum possible natural result.
- On an ace, add a modifier of +2 to the score.
- Only Pilots can ace.
- If the score has multiple dice, any die can cause an ace, but only one ace counts.      |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Critical]] | 
When a Pilot proactively hits the mark by 2 or more, they get a critical. It tends to provide results superior to a mere success.
- You can't get a critical on a reactive test. |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Fumble]]   | 
When a Pilot reactively misses the mark by 2 or more, they get a fumble. It indicates results even worse for the Pilot than a failure.
- You can't fumble on a proactive test.   |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Hit]]  | 
When the Pilot hits the mark in a test, the events that follow tend to be beneficial.  |
| [[Document Listing/Chapters/Folder 1 - First Steps/Tests Folder/Miss]]  | 
When the Pilot misses the mark on a test, the following events tend to be detrimental.  |



# Structuring Tests
The goal of any one test is to generate a score and compare it against a mark.

A test consists of dice, modifiers, and a mark. The test specifies which dice and modifiers are used. Specific rules may modify this structure.


| **Score Calculation** |
|:---:|
| Score = Dice + Modifiers |

All tests follow this basic resolution sequence, divided into stages.
1. Roll all dice used in the test.
	- Keep only the highest result, discarding all others.
	- On an ace, add a modifier of 2 to the next stage. 
	- Any used die can ace, but only one ace counts.
2. Sum all modifiers used in the test.
3. Generate a score by summing results from stages 1 and 2.
4. Compare the score to the test's mark.
5. Check the resolution table. It should be easy to internalize after a couple viewings.

|    Score vs Mark    | Proactive Tests | Reactive Tests |
| :-----------------: | :-------------: | :------------: |
| Lower by 2 or less  |      Miss       |     Fumble     |
|        Lower        |      Miss       |      Miss      |
|        Draw         |       Hit       |      Miss      |
|       Higher        |       Hit       |      Hit       |
| Higher by 2 or less |    Critical     |      Hit       |
