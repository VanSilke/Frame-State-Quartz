Players in Frame State take on one of two roles that of a Pilot, and of a Handler. The presence of a Handler is mandatory, along with a minimum of one Pilot, with up to three to five additional Pilots recommended.

While Pilots control individual machines, the Handler takes control of the world and all NPCs. 

The system can refer to the Pilot, Handler, or Unit. The last case is context-sensitive, and can refer to something controlled by either the Pilot or the Handler. Finally, the system can simply refer to you, in which case it concerns anyone who is currently interacting with the described element.
