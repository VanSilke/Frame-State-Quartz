The strength of a weapon is measured in tiers. Higher weapon tiers are slower and more expensive, but generally hit harder. They also have more points to spend on the properties of the weapon in question.
- Each weapon property has its own attribute, which can be increased with property points from 0 upward.
- Weapon type and damage type describe what each of the two properties actually do with the weapon.
