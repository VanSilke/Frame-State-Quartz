**Plating:** Anti-Energy Plating  
**Property:** Plasma (value)  
When you hit a designation with an energy weapon during discharge, and deal at least 1 point of unblocked damage, the designation takes damage equal to the listed plasma value at the beginning of its next turn. This damage recurs for one more turn and clears.  
**Special:** While the designation is suffering from plasma, subsequent hits with energy weapons with at least 1 plasma value add 1 to this recurring damage to the maximum of 5 and refresh the round count before plasma is extinguished.
