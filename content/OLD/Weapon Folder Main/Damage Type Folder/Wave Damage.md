**Plating:** Wave damage is compared against the lowest of all three plating types.  
**Property:** Resonance (value)  
When you hit a designation with a wave weapon during discharge, it resonates until the beginning of your next turn. All subsequent damage taken during this time is increased by the resonance value.  
**Special:** Wave weapons are rare, and need to be uncovered, reverse-engineered, or both, as part of downtime. They additionally require a wave generator on board.
